From https://golang.org/ref/spec

In go we have line comments //
and General comments /* */ like in c
Comment can not start inside rune or string literal

4 classes of tokens in go:
	identifiers -> such as variables and types
	keywords -> doesn't need an explanation
	operators&delimiteters -> 
	literals -> everything you can put into a variable like int float string etc. but this is constant!
